/*
 * The Prototype pattern is generally used when we have an instance of the class (prototype) and we'd like 
 * to create new objects by just copying the prototype.
 * Prototype design pattern mandates that the Object which you are copying should provide the copying feature. 
 * It should not be done by any other class. However whether to use shallow or deep copy of the Object properties 
 * depends on the requirements and its a design decision.

/* When to use the Prototype design pattern in Java?
 * The Prototype pattern is used when we need to create a number of instances of a class and each instance has almost same state or has very little difference.
