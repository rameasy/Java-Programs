JShell - REPL stands for Read-Eval-Print Loop. With JShell, java has REPL capability. Using REPL, we can code and test java based
logic without compiling using javac and see the result of calculations directly.

Java docs - In java 9, we can generate documentation in html 5 format by using -html5 option in command line arguments.
			javadoc -d C:/JAVA -html5 Tester.java

Multirelease JAR - A new feature is introduced where a jar format has been enhanced to have different versions of java class
			 or resources can be maintained and used as per the platform.In JAR, a file MANIFEST.MF file has a entry 
			 Multi-Release: true in its main section. META-INF directory also contains a versions subdirectory whose 
			 subdirectories (starting with 9 for Java 9 ) store version-specific classes and resource files.
			EG: 
			 C:\test > javac --release 9 java/com/example/Tester.java
			 C:\test > javac --release 7 java/com/example/Tester.java
			 C:\test > jar -c -f test.jar -C java7 . --release 9 -C java9.
			 With JDK 7 version:
			 C:\test > java -cp test.jar com.example.Tester
						Inside Java 7
			 With JDK 9 version:
			 C:\test > java -cp test.jar com.example.Tester
						Inside Java 9
