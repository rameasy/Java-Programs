In Java SE 7 or 8 versions, we should follow these rules to use Try-With-Resources statement for Automatic Resource Management(ARM)

Any Resource (which Pre-defined Java API class or User Defined class) must implement java.lang.AutoCloseable.
Resource object must refer either final or effectively final variable
If Resource is already declared outside the Try-With-Resources Statement, we should re-refer with local variable (As shown in the above Example-1 code)
That newly created local variable is valid to use within Try-With-Resources Statement.
Java SE 9: Try-With-Resources Improvements
Java SE 9 has provided some improvements to Try-With-Resources statement. As we discussed in previous sections, Java SE 7 or 8 versions have one small issue or bug with this statement.

In Java SE 9, if we have a resource which is already declared outside the Try-With-Resource Statement as final or effectively final, then we do NOT need to declare a local variable. We can use previously created variable within Try-With-Resource Statement without any issues as shown below:
